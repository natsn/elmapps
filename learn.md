# Guide to learning Elm

I would highly recommend _reading_ the guide and _writing_ elm code before watching any videos.

 - Read the [Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org). This is a gitbook by the creator of Elm
 - [Try Elm](elm-lang.org/try) out in the browser. (_Hint - try the stuff from the book_)
 - Watch a [video series](https://egghead.io/courses/start-using-elm-to-build-web-applications) to remind yourself of the concepts.
 - Complete the [Elm for beginners](http://courses.knowthen.com/p/elm-for-beginners) course over the weekend
 - Complete the [exercises](https://github.com/knowthen/elm) for that course
 - Oh! And setup your computer to to EÎ»my stuff:

# Dev Setup For Elm

 - Install [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 - Install elm with `npm install -g elm`
 - Configure [atom](https://github.com/knowthen/elm/blob/master/DEVSETUP.md).
   - `elm-oracle`, `elm-format`, `linter-elm-make` to lint on save.
